 LIST: 
    1. The list is a collection of index value pairs like that of the array in C++.
    2. list are ordered and mutable.

    4. Lists are created using square brackets []

 Dictionary:

Write about *args and **kwargs of Python with proper examples?
 ans: 
    * args: If we are don't know how many arguments that will be passed into our function, add a * before the parameter name in the function definition.

    def all_sum(num1, num2, *numbers):
    sum = 0 + num1 + num2
    for num in numbers:
        sum = sum + num
    return sum

total = all_sum(20,30,10,40)
print(total)

    **kwargs: **kwargs is used to pass a variable number of keyword arguments to a function. When we use **kwargs in a function definition, it allows the function to accept any number of keyword arguments, and these arguments are collected into a dictionary.

    # def famous(**kargs)
def famous_name(first, last, **addition):
    name = f' {first} {last}'
    # print(addition['title'])
    for key, value in addition.items():
        print(key, value)
    return name

name = famous_name(first='Taher', last='Ali', title="Hujur", title2="Shayokh", last2='taheri')
print(name)
